- This is kaggle competition I did where I had to predict the sales of the store. Here I performed time series analysis using automated machine learning library in python called autogluon which I applied after extracting features from the given data. I used the chornos model for prediction. 
- The datasets were too large for github so I didn't include them in the library but they can be easily accessed using the link below:
